Vui
Why are we playing on /map/
Entire map is filled with CRINGE!
I like turtles!!!!!!
Please keep chat civil and clean, no drama as all the admins are offline :/
I heard you guys didn't have any dicks.
This server is more cringe than roblox and that says something.
Hey guys, any fellow bronies or furries in chat?
What
Is there any intellectuals in chat?
Played College ball you know.
The animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night
Say my name.
This goes out to a warning for everyone in the server; if we catch you making penises out of props, you WILL be banned

I’d make a joke about you being in a coma, but folks derealize easily and would hate me for that, so… yeah.

I hate level 0, lets go to the POOLROOMS:)
Now I'm a little bit motivated
